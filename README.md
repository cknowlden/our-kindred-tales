Installation

1. Create a database named kindred-tales
2. The queries in database.sql are set up to create all required tables. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure you have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was what I used to create them.
3. Open your editor of choice and run npm install
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal

Usage
Upon load The app will reach out to your GCS database and pull any existing orders found there, You can then use the Drop down menu located on each item in the table and use the options there for each stage of the process.

Features
automated generation of a clean digital copy of the PDF
Allowing manual input of customer information to include, shipping address and phone number.
Automated generation of a PDF set to publisher specifications and sending the the created PDF directly to the publisher for production.
